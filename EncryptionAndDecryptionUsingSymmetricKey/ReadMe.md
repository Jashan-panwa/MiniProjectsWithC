# Encryption and Decryption Using Symmetric Key
This project demonstrates the implementation of encryption and decryption using symmetric key techniques in C.

## Introduction
This **C programming** project illustrates the fundamental concepts of symmetric key cryptography, 
where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption processes.

## Features
- Encrypt text messages using various symmetric key methods.
- Decrypt encrypted messages using the corresponding decryption techniques.
- Explore symmetric encryption concepts through simple code examples.
- Minimalistic project structure for educational purposes.
- Uses unlock feature with intractive messages.
- Durable for all types of input.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
$ git clone https://github.com/Jashan-panwa/MiniProjectsWithC.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
$ cd MiniProjectsWithC/EncryptionAndDecryptionUsingSymmetricKey
3. **Compile the program:**
$ gcc encryption_decryption.c -o encryption_decryption
4. **Run the program:**
$ ./encryption_decryption

## Follow the on-screen instructions to perform encryption and decryption .
text get siffted on the bases of key you enter , for alphabet key is resused after 26 and for numbers after 10.

## Feedback
your suggestions are welcome! Feel free to enhance the project by adding more encryption techniques, 
improving code readability, or fixing bugs. Submit your contributions via pull requests.

## License
i dont know much about license as this is my firt project, but i have made it on my own, not copied from someone , the encryption and decryption algorithm i have used , 
was a idea taken from a youtube channel(cecyours). if you like this code then you can use it , my only advice would be , instead of copy pasting , try to understand it 
and then impliment this your code self. comments in the code will help you a lot to understand.
